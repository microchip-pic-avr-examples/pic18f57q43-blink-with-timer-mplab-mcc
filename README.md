# Blink with Timer

This example shows how to configure an LED to blink periodically using drivers in MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC). The example uses the Pin Manager to configure the pin and generate an API with which the pin is later interfaced. Also, the timer driver is used to implement periodic interrupt between each time the pin output is toggled.

## Setup
MCC with Melody library was used to implement this example as shown in the following sections.
### Timer Driver
The Timer Driver was simply added to the project by locating it in the Device Resources pane on the left side in MCC. Within the Drivers menu (expand if needed, red box in image below)timer menu (expand if needed, green box in image below), click on the green plus next to where it says TMR0 (blue box in image below)

![MCC - Adding Timer Driver](images/MCC_add_timer_driver.png)
*Device Resources*

When the Timer Driver was added, it was shown in the Project Resources and in the Builder view as seen below.

*Builder*

### Timer Configuration
The Timer needs to be configured properly in order to have the code work properly.  There are a few possibilities of what you will see on your screen.  Feel free to skip ahead to the image that matches what you see on your screen.

There should be a tab on the right side that says "TMR0", click it (red box, see image below).

![MCC - Nav to Tmr Config 1](images/MCC_nav_to_tmr_config_1.png)
*TMR0 tab is vertical on the right*

Next click on the little black solid circle in the upper right of the screen (red box, see image below).

![MCC - Nav to Tmr Config 2](images/MCC_nav_to_tmr_config_2.png)
*TMR0 tab is selected, menu is behind builder tab*

Now, make sure that the configuration window looks EXACTLY like the one below.  Anything in a red box needs to be changed from the default value.

### Interrupt Configuration

### Pin Configuration

### Code Implementation

<!-- Explain how to connect hardware and set up software. Depending on complexity, step-by-step instructions and/or tables and/or images can be used -->
<!--
Within Timer 0 configuration window:
Clock prescaler 1:1024 (determines the upper and lower bounds of the 'Requested Period(s) line)
Timer Mode: 8-bit
Clock Source: FOSC/4
Requested Period: 0.5 (this gives a range of possible wait times)
Turn 'TMR Interrupt' on (circle on right, blue in switch)

In Interrupt Manager Tab:
Make sure that the 'Enable Isngle ISR Execution per entry' is on, everything else is off
TMR0 is included in the Interrupt Table and has the Enable box checked

Click on System-> Pins
In Pin grid view click on 'GPIO-output' for pin RF3
In Pins tab:
add a label to pin RF3, call it "LED_PIN" (in custon name column), make sure it does not have 'Start High, Week Pullup, or Open Drain' selected, also make sure that it has 'Analog, Slew Rate, and Input Level Control' selected.

Click on Generate

All of the necessary APIs should be created at this point except for one.

Above the main(void) line in the main.c code, add in the following function.
"void LED_PIN_ISR(void){ 
    LED_PIN_Toggle();
    }


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



INTERNAL (working code):
START CoDe:
#include "mcc_generated_files/system/system.h"

/*
    Main application
*/
/*
 Creating an empty function for the Timer0 to call on when an interrupt occurs.
 */
void LED_PIN_ISR(void){ 
    LED_PIN_Toggle(); //Turns the pin called 'LED_PIN' on or off depending on
                      //the current state of the pin. 
                      //see pins.h for exact function code
}
int main(void)
{
    SYSTEM_Initialize();
    LED_PIN_LAT = HIGH; //Turns LED off before running rest of code
    while(1)
    {
        INTERRUPT_GlobalInterruptEnable(); //turn on interrupts
        //When the registers TMR0L/H overflow, the function 'LED_PIN_ISR' gets executed
        Timer0_OverflowCallbackRegister(LED_PIN_ISR); 
        INTERRUPT_GlobalInterruptDisable(); //turn off interrupts
    }    
}

END CODE

## Operation
After having flashed the application to the PIC18F57Q47 Curiosity Nano, the onboard LED is blinking on and off.

## Summary

The example has shown how MCC can be used to configure the pins of the PIC18F57Q47 device.
